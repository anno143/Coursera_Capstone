Battle of Neighborhoods | Exploring Islamabad (IBM & Cursera Data Science Capstone Project)

In this project, we will explore, segment, and cluster the Zone-1 sectors in the city of Islamabad based on most common venue information. We will also try to answer following stakeholder questions so they can make investment decision:
1.	What are the most common venues in Zone-I?
2.	Which sectors in Zone-I have highest venues?
3.	Which sectors in Zone-I are yet to be developed based on most common venues?
